# An attempt to find and filter out the outliers from monte carlo image
# Assuming image created by Global Illumination monte carlo simulation

# Load the file

# Put into matricies

# Save into new files

# View each channel (R G B) independently

# Convert to HSV
# Save into separate H S V files

# View those files - is the problem easy to see?

# Make a map which clearly highlights the problem areas (the fire flies)

# Use that map to fix our image
# Fixing will probably be just blowing away our pixel and merging neighbor
# information.

# Save out the new image - DONE
